## User Story

    AS AN employer looking for candiates with experience building single-page applicatoins, 
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples, 
    SO THAT I can assess whether the applicant is a good candidate for an open position. 

## Features
    
The following components are included: 

- **Header:** Appears on multiple pages and contains the Navigation component.
- **Navigation:** Renders different sections of the portfolio and highlights the current section.
 - **Project:** Used multiple times in the Portfolio section to display my work samples.
- **Footer:** Appears on multiple pages with links to my social profiles.
 - **Contact Form:** Similar to the one built in the module project, includes fields for name, email address, and message, with validation.

    ### Projects

    Each project featured in the portfolio includes:

    - An image of the deployed application (either a GIF or a screenshot)
    - The title of the project
    - A link to the deployed application
    - A link to the corresponding GitHub repository

    ### Design

    The portfolio follows a mobile-first design approach and uses a custom color palette to stand out. The user interface is clean and polished, with large enough fonts for readability and animations to enhance the user

### `npm run build`

    -Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
    -It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance
